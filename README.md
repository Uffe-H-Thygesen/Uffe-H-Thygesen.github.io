# Uffe HÃ¸gsbro Thygesen

This is my personal main github page. It is under construction. Stay tuned for updates on: 

## SDEbook

My book on Stochastic Differential Equations for Science and Engineering, to be published by Taylor & Francis / CRC, in 2023. This web page will contain source code for figures, solutions to exercises, and supplementary course material. 

## SDEtools

My R-package for working with stochastic differential equations, including simulation, estimation, and optimal control. The package already exists on github (check my [repository](github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEtools), but the documentation is still being expanded.
