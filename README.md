# Uffe HÃ¸gsbro Thygesen

This is my personal main github page. Here you can find information on:

## [SDEbook](../SDEbook)

My book on Stochastic Differential Equations for Science and Engineering, to be published by Taylor & Francis / CRC, in 2023. This web page is still being polished but contains source code for figures, solutions to exercises, and supplementary course material. 

## [SDEtools](../SDEtools)

My R-package for working with stochastic differential equations, including simulation, estimation, and optimal control. The package is in a [github repository](https://github.com/Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEtools)). The documentation is still being expanded.
